# Schedule_One_Recipe_Builder

{WIP} please be patient on documentation. That will come later. If you did want to use the utility file and assets please use them on my utility release. They should work with python 3.6+ and make sure you include the modules used.

# Special Thanks

I wanted to extend a special thanks before continuing with this project to the people behind the website schedule1-calculator.com and their tireless work. Me making this project is in no way bashing their work. Please go check them out on their website.
